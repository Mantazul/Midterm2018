 SPECULATIONS:
   (All the conclusions are exempting Shell sort. I didn't have the time to study it.)

	 * For array size = 10 --> every algoritm is fast except Bucket Sort which takes 10 milli sec.
	 *For array size = 100 --> merge sort takes 3,bubble sort 1 and bucket sort 11 milli sec. all other 0 milli sec.
	 * For array size = 1000 --> heap sort takes 0 milli sec and bubble(7 ms) and bucket(9ms) sort take most time.
	 * For array size = 10000 --> heap and quick (4ms) is fastest, merge (8ms), bucket(13 ms) is faster, selection(53ms),Insertion(81ms)
	  is slow and bubble sort(198ms) is slowest
     *For array size = 100000 --> bucket(11ms) is fastest. heap(16ms),quick(19),merge(40) is faster. selection(4349ms),
		insertion(7184ms) is slow. bubble sort(22573ms) is slowest.

	CONCLUSION:

   So, the conclusion is that, bubble sort, selection sort and insertin sort are fastest sorting
        algorithm for small sized array and bucket sort is the worst.
   For array with average size, heap sort and quick sort  fastest.
   For array with large data size, bucket sort, heap sort, quick sort and merge sort are the best sorting algorithm.
